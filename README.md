## Project proposal

Members: samuelv4

I would like to join the text classification competition. I am prepared to learn state-of-the-art neural network classifiers. I have worked in a NN competition before and I would love to do it again. I haven't worked a lot on text classification but I have worked with LSTM networks which might help me to ramp up and learn the state-of-the-art for the competition. I am planning on using python and known libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
